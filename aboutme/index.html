    <h2>Braeden Pope</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Braeden Pope. I'm from Seattle, Washington, but my family moved
        here just under 2 years ago. I come from a family of 6, I have one older brother and two younger sisters, 
        plus my mom and dad. My dad is a professor here at BYUI, he teaches Business Managament.</p>

    <p> My major is Software Engineering. I've always really enjoyed using technology and computers, so this route
        felt like a good move. I really enjoy puzzling out problems and finding ways to make something more simple
        and efficient.
    </p>

    <p>This is my second semester at BYUI. I love attending BYUI because of the opportunities to learn, meet people,
        and really explore what interests me. The environment resolving around the gospel of Jesus Christ helps
        me feel safe, and more confident in my testimony.</p>

    <p> I enjoy reading, playing tabletop games, and writing stories. I served a mission in Colorado from 2020
        to 2022. I've been a member of the church my whole life, and I've really come to love the Book of Mormon.
        The teachings it contains has really helped me understand more of who God is, and who I am as a son of God
        with divine potential.</p>
