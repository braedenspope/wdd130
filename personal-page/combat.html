              Combat is one of the most exciting and frightening parts of Dungeons and Dragons and is where many cool moments originate. But for a newcomer, it can seem complicated and confusing. Here’s some important keywords and things to remember for when your Dungeon Master asks you to roll initiative!
            </p>
            <h3>Initiative</h3>
            <p>
              Before combat begins, your Dungeon Master will have everyone roll Initiative. Your initiative bonus will be listed at the top middle of your character sheet (or elsewhere depending on what sheet you’re using) and is the number you add to your roll of a d20. The other players also roll, as well as the Dungeon Master for whatever you will be fighting. The Dungeon Master takes everyone’s Initiative totals, and places them in order of highest to lowest. After that, everyone takes turns doing whatever they want for the combat, with the character with the highest initiative going first and the character with the lowest going last. Once everyone has gone, the first person goes again, and this repeats until the combat ends!
            </p>
            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>
              On your turn, you have 3 things you can do. You have your action, a bonus action, and movement. At the top of your sheet your speed is listed, and that is how far you can move in a single turn. For your action and bonus action, your character sheet will tell you what things you can do, and which of the two require an action or bonus action. There are also some universal actions anyone can take, such as Attack, Dodge, Disengage, and Dash. The Dodge action means that any attacks made against you until your next turn have disadvantage. Disadvantage means the attacker must roll a d20 twice, and take the lower roll, meaning they have a smaller chance of hitting you. The Disengage action means that enemies you are next to do not get attacks of opportunity to hit you if you move away from them. The Dash action means that you get to move your movement again.

            <h3>Attack</h3>
            <p>
              If you attack as an action, you pick a weapon you have and roll a d20. The chosen weapon has an attack bonus that you add to your roll. To hit the target, the total must be equal to or higher than the target’s armor class (AC). If it’s higher, than you get to roll damage for the attack. Depending on the weapon used, the die you roll will be different, so check your sheet to see which one to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Reaction</h3>
            <p>
              When it’s not your turn, you also have one reaction per round of combat. A reaction is something you can do when a certain event happens when it’s not your turn. Your sheet will tell you if you have certain features that trigger a reaction. One universal reaction is when an enemy that is next to you attempts to move away from you, you can use your reaction to make an attack against them. You can choose whether to use your reaction or not.
