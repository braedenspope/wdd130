                Some of the basic resources you'll need in order to play dungeons and dragons is a set of dice, which includes a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. The number of each is how many sides the dice have, with a d6 being a convential gaming dice. You'll also want a character sheet, and a copy of the "Player's Handbook" from Wizards of the Coast. That book will have all you need for some basic options for making a player character.
