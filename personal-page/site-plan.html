      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'm a computer programmer, something I’ve done for the last couple of years. I’m also a huge fan of 
         Dungeons and Dragons. It’s a fantasy roleplaying game where players go on adventures together narrated
         by a game master. I've played for several years, both as a player and as a game master. But a lot of
         people don't know much about the game, or don't know how to learn. Have you ever wanted to learn more about
         something, but ended up not looking into it because you weren't sure where to start? My website would offer
         newcomers to the world of Dungeons and Dragons a place to learn the basics of what they need in order to play,
         how to make a character, and how to play. Real life examples will be given of characters, situations, and stories
        to help them better see the infinite possibilities of this tabletop game. </p> 


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is the people that have heard of Dungeons and Dragons, but don't know where to learn more or how to 
          start. The people that want to hear about stories, characters, scenarios, and player reviews. People looking for a
        one-stop shop for learning about the game, and getting started themselves.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Have you heard of Dungeons and Dragons, the tabletop roleplaying game? Have you wondered how to play it, but have struggled where to start? Welcome to Adventures and Advice, the site for quick tips on how to start adventuring! Below are two sections for some short and quick tips for making a player character, as well as the basics of what to do during combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the basic resources you'll need in order to play dungeons and dragons is a set of dice, which includes a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. The number of each is how many sides the dice have, with a d6 being a convential gaming dice. You'll also want a character sheet, and a copy of the "Player's Handbook" from Wizards of the Coast. That book will have all you need for some basic options for making a player character.

      <h3>Character Creation</h3>
      <p>
        Characters
      </p>
      <p>      
        Character Creation is one of the most important parts of playing Dungeons and Dragons. The character you create can have an affect on how you think, act, and play the game. Some players like to optimize their character that they are extremely good at a certain skill or in combat, some create their character solely around the roleplaying possibilities it makes, and some go for a healthy mix of both. It’s up to you to decide how you want to design your character, but here’s some important categories that you should keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Balance/Optimization. Although Dungeons and Dragons doesn’t play like a traditional board or dice game, it is still a game. And how you design your character, meaning your class, race, and background, are what decide what you’re able to do in the game and how well you can do it. Choose what the character features in a way that you’ll be able to have fun, but also think about what you want your character to be good at. Sometimes your Dungeon Master will have limitations on some options due to the setting of the game, so they’re an excellent resource to see what can fit into the world. Don’t be afraid to play a certain way because it may seem like you aren’t able to be as cool as other characters but do what you find exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backstory/Background. Some Dungeon Masters may play the game avoiding a lot of roleplaying or backstory information, but many do. As you design your character, think about who they are. What brought them to where they are today? Do they have family, close friends, or acquaintances that they can talk to? What is their motivation for becoming an adventurer? Use the class, background, and race you choose for your character to better understand who they were before, and who they are now. Work with your Dungeon Master to better understand the setting of the game, and your character will be able to fit into the world comfortably. A character that fits into the world helps you better immerse yourself into the fantasy world and can help the Dungeon Master make the game more fun for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Player-Friendly. Although you can design your character any way you want, it’s important to keep in mind that you’re going to be playing with other people. You’re going to be put into environments that can require teamwork and communication. If you design a character that doesn’t work well with others, it can lead to making the game less fun for the other players. Characters should have unique personalities but avoid creating and playing them against other player characters. Decide where your characters boundaries are but be ready to have them challenged. Don’t be afraid to challenge other players too!

      <h3>Combat Encounters</h3>
      <p>
        Combat Encounters
      </p>
      <p>
        Combat is one of the most exciting and frightening parts of Dungeons and Dragons and is where many cool moments originate. But for a newcomer, it can seem complicated and confusing. Here’s some important keywords and things to remember for when your Dungeon Master asks you to roll initiative!
      </p>
      <p>
        Initiative. Before combat begins, your Dungeon Master will have everyone roll Initiative. Your initiative bonus will be listed at the top middle of your character sheet (or elsewhere depending on what sheet you’re using) and is the number you add to your roll of a d20. The other players also roll, as well as the Dungeon Master for whatever you will be fighting. The Dungeon Master takes everyone’s Initiative totals, and places them in order of highest to lowest. After that, everyone takes turns doing whatever they want for the combat, with the character with the highest initiative going first and the character with the lowest going last. Once everyone has gone, the first person goes again, and this repeats until the combat ends!
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions. On your turn, you have 3 things you can do. You have your action, a bonus action, and movement. At the top of your sheet your speed is listed, and that is how far you can move in a single turn. For your action and bonus action, your character sheet will tell you what things you can do, and which of the two require an action or bonus action. There are also some universal actions anyone can take, such as Attack, Dodge, Disengage, and Dash. The Dodge action means that any attacks made against you until your next turn have disadvantage. Disadvantage means the attacker must roll a d20 twice, and take the lower roll, meaning they have a smaller chance of hitting you. The Disengage action means that enemies you are next to do not get attacks of opportunity to hit you if you move away from them. The Dash action means that you get to move your movement again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Attack. If you attack as an action, you pick a weapon you have and roll a d20. The chosen weapon has an attack bonus that you add to your roll. To hit the target, the total must be equal to or higher than the target’s armor class (AC). If it’s higher, than you get to roll damage for the attack. Depending on the weapon used, the die you roll will be different, so check your sheet to see which one to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaction. When it’s not your turn, you also have one reaction per round of combat. A reaction is something you can do when a certain event happens when it’s not your turn. Your sheet will tell you if you have certain features that trigger a reaction. One universal reaction is when an enemy that is next to you attempts to move away from you, you can use your reaction to make an attack against them. You can choose whether to use your reaction or not.
